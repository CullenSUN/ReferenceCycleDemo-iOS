# ReferenceCycleDemo-iOS

Memory management for a programmer is usually not trivial. Thanks to Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), memory management is made easy for iOS developers. It just works most of time. However, reference cycle is very tricky, and I have seen some experienced developers also made such mistakes. 

Here is a demonstration to show how the reference cycle will happen and how to resolve it in an iOS project.

You can also read Swift's official document about this topic, [Automatic Reference Counting](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/automaticreferencecounting/).
